# Machine Learning Notes 

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries from a machine learning course. The notes are organized into folders, each covering a specific topic in machine learning.

## Folder Structure

- **Linear Regression**: Notes on linear regression, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Logistic Regression**: Notes on logistic regression, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Decision Tree**: Notes on decision trees, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Random Forest**: Notes on random forests, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Naive Bayes**: Notes on naive Bayes, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Support Vector Machines**: Notes on support vector machines, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Notes on advanced machine learning concepts, including regularization, bias-variance tradeoff, and model selection.
- **Clustering**: Notes on clustering algorithms, including k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Neural Networks**: Notes on neural networks, including mathematical derivations, algorithms, and implementation in Python.

## Note Format

Each folder contains a series of markdown files, each covering a specific topic within the folder. The notes are written in a clear and concise manner, with mathematical derivations and algorithms explained step-by-step. Python implementation is provided for each topic, using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
