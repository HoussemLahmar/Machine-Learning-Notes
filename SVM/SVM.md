# Support Vector Machines Course Notes

## 1. Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The goal of an SVM is to find a decision boundary that maximally separates the classes in the feature space.

### Key Concepts

- **Maximum-margin classifier**: An SVM is a maximum-margin classifier, which means it tries to find the decision boundary that maximally separates the classes.
- **Hyperplane**: A hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates the classes in the feature space.
- **Support vectors**: Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and have the most influence on its position.

## 2. Linear SVM Classification

Linear SVM classification involves finding a hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in the feature space.

### Mathematical Formulation

Given a dataset ${(x_i, y_i)}_{i=1}^n$, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$, the goal is to find a hyperplane $w^T x + b = 0$ that maximally separates the classes.

The optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$
\max_{w, b} \frac{1}{||w||} \sum_{i=1}^n y_i (w^T x_i + b)
$$

subject to:

$$
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1, \quad i=1, \ldots, n
$$

### Algorithm

The algorithm for linear SVM classification involves the following steps:

1. **Data preparation**: Prepare the dataset by scaling the features and converting the class labels to $\{-1, 1\}$.
2. **Optimization**: Solve the optimization problem using a quadratic programming solver.
3. **Hyperplane calculation**: Calculate the hyperplane $w^T x + b = 0$ using the optimized values of $w$ and $b$.
4. **Classification**: Classify new data points by evaluating the sign of $w^T x + b$.

## 3. Nonlinear SVM Classification

Nonlinear SVM classification involves finding a hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in a higher-dimensional feature space.

### a. Polynomial Kernel

The polynomial kernel is a popular kernel function used in nonlinear SVM classification. It is defined as:

$$
K(x, x') = (x^T x' + 1)^d
$$

where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial.

### b. Adding Similarity Features

Another approach to nonlinear SVM classification is to add similarity features to the original feature space. This involves computing the similarity between each pair of data points using a kernel function and adding these similarities as new features.

## 4. SVM Regression

SVM regression involves finding a hyperplane that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values.

### a. Under the Hood

The optimization problem for SVM regression can be formulated as:

$$
\min_{w, b} \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - (w^T x_i + b)|
$$

subject to:

$$
|y_i - (w^T x_i + b)| \leq \epsilon, \quad i=1, \ldots, n
$$

where $C$ is the regularization parameter and $\epsilon$ is the error tolerance.

## 5. Hyperparameter Optimization

Hyperparameter optimization involves finding the optimal values of the regularization parameter $C$ and the kernel parameter (e.g., degree of the polynomial kernel) using techniques such as grid search or cross-validation.

## 6. Summary

Support Vector Machines are a powerful tool for classification and regression tasks. They involve finding a decision boundary that maximally separates the classes in the feature space. SVMs can be used for linear and nonlinear classification, as well as regression tasks. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in SVM modeling.

### Advantages of SVMs

- **Robust to outliers**: SVMs are robust to outliers and noisy data.
- **Flexible**: SVMs can be used for linear and nonlinear classification, as well as regression tasks.
- **High accuracy**: SVMs can achieve high accuracy in many applications.

### Disadvantages of SVMs

- **Computational complexity**: SVMs can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
- **Sensitive to hyperparameters**: SVMs are sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, which can affect their performance.

### Real-World Applications of SVMs

- **Image classification**: SVMs are widely used in image classification tasks, such as object recognition and facial recognition.
- **Text classification**: SVMs are used in text classification tasks, such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.
- **Bioinformatics**: SVMs are used in bioinformatics to classify protein sequences and predict gene function.

## 7. Soft Margin SVM

In the previous sections, we assumed that the data is linearly separable. However, in real-world applications, the data may not always be linearly separable. To handle this, we can use the soft margin SVM.

### Mathematical Formulation

The soft margin SVM involves introducing slack variables $\xi_i$ to allow for some misclassifications. The optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$
\min_{w, b, \xi} \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i
$$

subject to:

$$
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad i=1, \ldots, n
$$

$$
\xi_i \geq 0, \quad i=1, \ldots, n
$$

### Algorithm

The algorithm for soft margin SVM involves the following steps:

1. **Data preparation**: Prepare the dataset by scaling the features and converting the class labels to $\{-1, 1\}$.
2. **Optimization**: Solve the optimization problem using a quadratic programming solver.
3. **Hyperplane calculation**: Calculate the hyperplane $w^T x + b = 0$ using the optimized values of $w$ and $b$.
4. **Classification**: Classify new data points by evaluating the sign of $w^T x + b$.

## 8. Kernel Trick

The kernel trick is a method used to transform the data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it is easier to find a separating hyperplane.

### Mathematical Formulation

The kernel trick involves computing the dot product of the data points in the higher-dimensional feature space using a kernel function $K(x, x')$. The kernel function can be written as:

$$
K(x, x') = \phi(x)^T \phi(x')
$$

where $\phi(x)$ is a mapping function that transforms the data point $x$ into the higher-dimensional feature space.

### Popular Kernel Functions

Some popular kernel functions include:

- **Linear kernel**: $K(x, x') = x^T x'$
- **Polynomial kernel**: $K(x, x') = (x^T x' + 1)^d$
- **Radial basis function (RBF) kernel**: $K(x, x') = \exp(-\gamma ||x - x'||^2)$

## 9. SVM Implementation in Python

SVMs can be implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library.

### Code Example

```python
from sklearn import svm

# Create an SVM classifier with a linear kernel
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1)

# Train the classifier on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
