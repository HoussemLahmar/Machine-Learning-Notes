# Clustering with TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a powerful library for machine learning and deep learning tasks. Although TensorFlow is primarily used for deep learning, it also supports clustering algorithms, including K-Means clustering. This guide covers the basics of performing clustering with TensorFlow.

## 1. Introduction to TensorFlow Clustering

TensorFlow provides the `tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.KMeans` class for K-Means clustering. This allows you to perform clustering with TensorFlow’s computational graph and optimizations.

### 1.1 K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering partitions data into \( k \) clusters, where each cluster is represented by a centroid. The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster.

## 2. K-Means Clustering with TensorFlow

### 2.1 Installation

Ensure TensorFlow is installed. You can install TensorFlow via pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### 2.2 Basic Usage

Here's a basic example of K-Means clustering using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Convert to TensorFlow Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(X).batch(len(X))

# Initialize KMeans with k clusters
kmeans = tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.KMeans(
    num_clusters=2,
    use_mini_batch=False
)

# Fit the model
kmeans.train(input_fn=lambda: dataset)

# Get cluster centroids
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers()

# Get cluster labels
def assign_clusters(X, centroids):
    distances = np.linalg.norm(X[:, np.newaxis] - centroids, axis=2)
    return np.argmin(distances, axis=1)

labels = assign_clusters(X, centroids)

print("Cluster centroids:", centroids)
print("Cluster labels:", labels)
```

### 2.3 Parameters

- `num_clusters`: Number of clusters to form.
- `use_mini_batch`: Whether to use mini-batch K-Means or full-batch K-Means.

### 2.4 Visualization

You can visualize clusters using `matplotlib`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot data points
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, s=50, cmap='viridis')

# Plot cluster centroids
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], c='red', s=200, alpha=0.75, marker='X')

plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering with TensorFlow')
plt.show()
```

## 3. Advanced Clustering with TensorFlow

While TensorFlow’s native support for clustering is limited to K-Means, you can use TensorFlow for more advanced clustering tasks by integrating it with other libraries or by implementing custom clustering algorithms.

### 3.1 Custom Clustering Algorithms

For custom clustering algorithms, you can use TensorFlow’s low-level operations to define and optimize clustering algorithms.

### 3.2 Integration with Other Libraries

You can integrate TensorFlow with libraries like scikit-learn for more advanced clustering techniques. For example, you can use TensorFlow to compute feature embeddings and then apply scikit-learn’s clustering algorithms on those embeddings.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

For evaluating clustering results, you can use metrics like the Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index.

### 4.1 Silhouette Score

The silhouette score measures the quality of the clusters. It can be computed using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Compute silhouette score
silhouette = silhouette_score(X, labels)
print("Silhouette Score:", silhouette)
```

### 4.2 Adjusted Rand Index

The adjusted Rand index (ARI) measures the similarity between true labels and cluster labels:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score

# True labels (for evaluation purposes)
true_labels = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

# Compute ARI
ari = adjusted_rand_score(true_labels, labels)
print("Adjusted Rand Index:", ari)
```

## 5. Conclusion

TensorFlow provides basic support for K-Means clustering, allowing you to leverage TensorFlow’s computational graph for clustering tasks. For more advanced clustering techniques, you may need to integrate TensorFlow with other libraries or implement custom algorithms.
