# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow

## 1. Introducing the CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model designed to process and classify grid-like data such as images. They utilize convolutional layers to detect features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification.

### Key Concepts
- **Local Receptive Fields:** Neurons in a convolutional layer are connected to small regions of the input.
- **Shared Weights:** Filters (kernels) are applied across the entire input.
- **Spatial Hierarchy:** Captures features like edges, textures, and shapes.

## 2. Understanding the ConvNet Topology

CNNs are typically composed of several key layers:
- **Input Layer:** The raw image data.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features using convolutional filters.
- **Activation Layers:** Apply non-linear functions (e.g., ReLU).
- **Pooling Layers:** Downsample the feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification or regression.

### CNN Architecture

```
Input Image -> Convolution Layer -> Activation Function -> Pooling Layer -> Fully Connected Layer -> Output
```

## 3. Understanding Convolution Layers

Convolution layers apply filters to the input image to generate feature maps. Each filter detects specific features such as edges or textures.

### Mathematical Model

For a 2D convolution:

$$
S(i, j) = \sum_{m=0}^{M-1} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} I(i+m, j+n) \cdot K(m, n) + B
$$

where:
- \( S(i, j) \) is the output feature map at position \((i, j)\),
- \( I \) is the input image,
- \( K \) is the convolution kernel,
- \( B \) is the bias term,
- \( M \) and \( N \) are the dimensions of the kernel.

### TensorFlow Implementation

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D

# Define a convolutional layer
conv_layer = Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
```

## 4. Understanding Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to decrease the computational load and control overfitting.

### Mathematical Model

For max pooling:

$$
P(i, j) = \max_{(m, n) \in \text{pool\_region}} F(i+m, j+n)
$$

where:
- \( P(i, j) \) is the pooled feature map value,
- \( F \) is the feature map,
- The pooling region is defined by the pooling window size.

### TensorFlow Implementation

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling2D

# Define a max pooling layer
pool_layer = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))
```

## 5. Training a ConvNet

Training a CNN involves feeding labeled data, optimizing the network parameters, and evaluating its performance.

### Training Steps
1. **Data Preparation:** Normalize images and split into training and test sets.
2. **Model Definition:** Construct the CNN architecture.
3. **Compilation:** Select optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.
4. **Training:** Fit the model on the training data.
5. **Evaluation:** Test the model on unseen data.

### TensorFlow Example

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and preprocess dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train[..., np.newaxis] / 255.0
X_test = X_test[..., np.newaxis] / 255.0

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

## 6. Putting It All Together

Combining convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers results in a complete CNN architecture capable of learning and classifying complex patterns in image data.

### Full CNN Example

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the complete CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## 7. Applying a CNN

CNNs are used in various applications including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

### Example Application: Image Classification

1. **Load Data:** Utilize datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10.
2. **Train Model:** Use the CNN architecture defined earlier.
3. **Evaluate:** Assess performance on test data.
4. **Deploy:** Apply the trained model to new images for predictions.

### TensorFlow Prediction Code

```python
# Predict on new images
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Convert predictions to class labels
predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
```
